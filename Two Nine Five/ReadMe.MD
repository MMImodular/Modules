# Two Nine Five

* Eurorack adaptation of the Buchla Model 295 10-channel comb filter
* 10 LED sliders control the amplitude of each band sent through the SUM output
* Individual channel outputs to the right of each slider
* Tunable band frequencies, Q's, and amplitude via trim pots on the back of the module.

This recreation of the Model 295 has been in my head since before I owned any modular. After using a restored Buchla at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music, the 295 became one of my favorite modules in the whole case. Buchla modular is far out of my budget so with the original schematics in hand, I made a much more compact 3U version of it. The circuitry is exactly the same, though more modern op-amps have to be used since the ones used in the original design are no longer available.

**Things to note when building**

It is absolutely imperative that you solder R13, R39, R17, R37, R19, R35, R25, and R33 properly before mounting the trim pots as they will be very difficult to reach once all components are in place. To confirm they are soldered properly, measure the resistance between the two middle pins of each trim pot location. For instance, the resistance between the middle pin of VR10 and VR9 should be roughly 68 kOhms.

In addition, please heed the warning on the front of the PCB and place the trim pots on the back of the module. There is not enough space between the PCB and panel for the trim pots and having them on the back allows for you to tune everything without taking the panel off. I kept the silk screen for the pots on the top side in order to avoid cluttering the bottom silkscreen layer.
