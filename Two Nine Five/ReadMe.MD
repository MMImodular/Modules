# Two Nine Five

**Two Nine Five is currently in prototyping stages. The data here is to help beta testers with their builds. Nothing is guaranteed to work just yet.**

* Eurorack adaptation of the Buchla Model 295 10-channel comb filter
* 10 LED sliders control the amplitude of each band sent through the SUM output
* Individual channel outputs to the right of each slider
* Tunable band frequencies, Q's, and amplitude via trim pots on the back of the module.

This recreation of the Model 295 has been in my head since before I owned any modular. After using a restored Buchla at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music, the 295 became one of my favorite modules in the whole case. Buchla modular is far out of my budget so with the original schematics in hand, I made a much more compact 3U version of it. The circuitry is exactly the same, though more modern op-amps have to be used since the ones used in the original design are no longer available.
