# Octaverter

**Octaverter is currently in prototyping stages. The data here is to help beta testers with their builds. Nothing is guaranteed to work just yet.**

* 8 attenuverters in 12hp
* Each attenuverter is normalled to the one below it if no plug is inserted to its output
* Each input is normalled to 5V if no plug is inserted
* Each attenuverter has a gain of 1.5
* Bi-color LEDs to help visualize the output, red for negative, green for positive

Octaverter has been in the works for several months and has gone through a record number of revisions. This is 5th and hopefully last version of the module. Octaverter is a one-stop-shop for many functions beyond just attenuversion. It can be used as a mixer, offset generator, sidechain generator, amplifier, and even distortion.
