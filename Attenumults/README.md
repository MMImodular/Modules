# Attenumults
* Dual 1:4 buffered multiple that has individual attenuverters on each output
* Dual 3:1 unity mixers are at the bottom to provide extra utility

Attenumults allows you to control a number of parameters at once in different directions and magnitudes, a useful utility module and a perfect complement to Maths or Rampage.
