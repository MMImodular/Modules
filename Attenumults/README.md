Attenumults is a dual 1:4 buffered multiple that has individual attenuverters on each output. 
Two 3:1 unity mixers are at the bottom to provide extra utility.
Attenumults allows you to control a number of parameters at once in different directions and magnitudes. 
It is a useful utility module and a perfect complement to Maths or Rampage.
