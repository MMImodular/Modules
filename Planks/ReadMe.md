# Planks
* Dual 4:1 precision adder
* Capable of adding pitch CV with no discernable variation in pitch

Planks is a slim and simple dual precision adder. It allows you to add two quantized values together and output the expected sum with very little drift. Perfect for making a third sequence by adding two separate ones up.
Planks can also act as a DC-coupled unity gain mixer for audio and CV.
