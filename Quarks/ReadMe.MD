# Quarks
I made this panel for the jakplugg 22hp Elements rework. It can be found here: https://github.com/jakplugg/Quarks

It is designed to be fabricated as a PCB for cost savings. The panel is built for 3mm LEDs, not the typical 5mm LEDs used by Elements, so keep that in mind when buying parts. You could drill it out or change the .brd file if you opt for larger LEDs.
