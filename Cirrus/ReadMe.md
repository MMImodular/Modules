# Cirrus
* Replaced plastic gain potentiometer with dual gang Alpha style potentiometer. These can be found [here](https://www.thonk.co.uk/shop/alpha-9mm-pots-dshaft/)
* Changed all 10uF capacitors to the Panasonic B footprint. Dimensions can be found [here](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/315/ABA0000C1251-1138508.pdf)
* Moved some capacitors around to make hand soldering easier

Cirrus is my rework of the popular Clouds module, originally designed by Olivier Gillet of Mutable Instruments. After building several Clouds myself, I found several problems that were easy to fix with a simple PCB revision. I decided it would be worth the effort, so here it is.
