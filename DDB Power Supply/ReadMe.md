# DDB Power Supply
* Utilizes two center-positive isolated DC power bricks to provide Eurorack standard power
* Low-cost design and chainable busboards allow for easy expansion
* +5V regulators per board
* Screw terminals for chaining boards in a system

I created this power supply after building a Trogotronic M15 system. It is based on the same idea of chaining two 12V DC bricks in series to provide bipolar 12V and regulating the +12V rail to provide +5V as necessary.
I disliked the layout of the M15 system and figured I would correct my gripes in this design. It may not be perfect, but if you want perfect, you'd probably be using a linear supply.
These boards can act as bus boards for other supplies. Just connect +/-12V and ground to the proper headers on one of the screw terminals and you're good to go.
