# Passive Attenuators
Here are two versions of my passive attenuation module, both have very similar functionality. 

Quick Fix Mix is my first revision, with 5 potentiometers and SMD on the front.

Quick Mix is my second revision, with 6 potentiometers (the 6th controls the level of the mix output) and SMD on the back.
