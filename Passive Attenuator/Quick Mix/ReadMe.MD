# Quick Mix
* 5 passive attenuators with individual outs
* Any output which does not have a cable inserted will be summed at the bottom output
* MIX knob controls the level for the mix output

Quick Mix is a 5 channel passive attenuator and mixer designed to fit as much as physically possible in 4hp. 

It does this by making use of a modified Thonkiconn jack footprint. This footprint requires the ground pin to be bent inwards and to the side, allowing jacks to fit closer together.

Panel designed by me and is my first attempt at a consistent design language between multiple modules.
